Tax Tools
=========

Taxman provides a set of tools for computing Income Tax for the UK tax system.

It currently supports computing Income Tax and National Insurance (both employer's and employee's),
and deducting these to return the net income. In addition, it can only calculate these for tax year
2018-19, but will be extended to make it easy to support any tax year.
